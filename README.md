# Matplotlib Homework - The Power of Plots

Observations:

1) there is relatively equal gender split: female - 49.8%, male - 50.2%

2) There is a relatively strong positive correlation (0.84) between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin regimen., e.g. the higher the weight of the mouse, the higher the tumore volume observed. 

3) the analysis of the tumore volume at different datapoints for a single mouse (ID m601) treated with Capomulin suggested the decrease of the tumor volume  throughout time.
